 Car Price Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression

This project predicts the price of a car based on various features such as engine size, horsepower, mileage, fuel type, and more.
The model is built using Multiple Linear Regression and implemented in Python (Google Colab).


🚗 Project Overview
